This is a Adhoc multiplayer demo that leverages Device Maps, the datastore and Niantic's native networking.
It shows how to create, persist and sync content across multiple clients.
Press Create to make a network room, others can join that room if they use the same name.
Users can place cubes. The cubes will sync across all clients and persist.
Rooms are cleaned up in a few weeks.
